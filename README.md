1)  Assuming integers are represented as 16-bit words and negative numbers are represented using the 2’s complementary method, convert the following hexadecimal numbers to decimal numbers (show your work). Hint: you should figure whether a number is a negative one before using the positional formula discussed in the class.

a. OxCAFE, b. Ox4DAD, c. OxFACE

2)  Assuming integers are represented as 32-bit words and negative numbers are represented using the 2’s complimentary method convert the following decimal numbers to hexadecimal numbers (show your work). a. -1779, b. 2020

3)  Represent following floating-point numbers in IEEE single-precision (32-bit) format:

a. -0.1875, b. 0.46875

Show the steps done to reach the answer for each (i.e. how to get the S-bit, the exponent, and the fraction field of the answer).

4)  What is the decimal value of the following IEEE single-precision (32-bit) floating-point numbers (which are shown in hexadecimal)?

a. 3F400000, b. 8E000000

Show the steps done to reach the answer for each.

5. Show the representation of the string “Comets are great!” in the memory of a MIPS based system using the NULL-terminated method. Explain how it was done.
